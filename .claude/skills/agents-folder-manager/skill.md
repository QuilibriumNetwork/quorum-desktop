# .agents Folder Infrastructure Manager

Automatically manages the complete `.agents` folder infrastructure with full integration across all systems: docs-manager skill, indexing, dev web UI, routing, and status detection.

## Auto-Activation Triggers

This skill automatically activates when you mention:

**Folder Management:**
- "add/create new folder to .agents"
- "remove/delete .agents folder"
- "rename .agents folder"
- "manage .agents structure"
- "restructure documentation folders"

**Specific Operations:**
- "create analyses folder"
- "add reports directory"
- "remove bugs folder"
- "rename tasks to work-items"
- "add .pending subfolder"
- "create .reviewed status folder"

**System Integration:**
- "update .agents infrastructure"
- "integrate new documentation folder"
- "fix .agents folder structure"

## Skill Coordination

This skill focuses on **folder structure and system integration**. For document creation within folders, the `docs-manager` skill handles content and templates.

**Coordination with docs-manager:**
- After creating new folders, may suggest updating docs-manager templates
- Validates that folder changes don't break docs-manager workflows
- Ensures new folder types are added to docs-manager if needed

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Structure Analysis & Validation**
- Scans current `.agents` folder structure
- Identifies existing folders, subfolders, and status systems
- Validates current integration state across all systems
- Detects potential conflicts or dependencies
- Reports current state and readiness for changes

### 2. **Automated Folder Operations**
- **ADD**: Creates new top-level folders with complete integration
- **REMOVE**: Safely removes folders with backup and cleanup
- **RENAME**: Renames folders while preserving all content
- **SUBFOLDER**: Adds/removes status subfolders with migration support
- **VALIDATE**: Checks and repairs existing integrations

### 3. **Complete System Integration**
Automatically updates all required systems:
- docs-manager skill configuration and templates
- Index generation scripts (both copies)
- Dev web UI navigation and components
- Routing configuration and lazy imports
- Status detection and TypeScript types
- File scanning and JSON generation
- Workflow documentation updates

### 4. **Safety & Validation**
- Pre-operation validation and conflict detection
- Automatic backup creation before destructive operations
- Step-by-step progress reporting with rollback capability
- Icon existence verification before UI updates
- TypeScript compilation validation
- End-to-end integration testing

### 5. **Interactive Workflow**
- Asks clarifying questions for ambiguous requests
- Shows preview of changes before execution
- Requests confirmation for destructive operations
- Provides real-time progress updates
- Suggests optimal folder structures and naming

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
1. **Scan Current Structure**
   - Analyze `.agents` folder hierarchy
   - Identify existing integrations
   - Check system health and consistency

2. **Understand Request**
   - Parse user intent (add/remove/rename/subfolder)

   - Identify all files that need updates
   - Plan backup and rollback strategy
   - Estimate completion time and complexity

### Phase 2: User Confirmation
1. **Present Analysis**
   - Show current state vs desired state
   - List all files that will be modified
   - Explain potential risks and mitigations

2. **Request Confirmation**
   - Get user approval for the plan
   - Confirm destructive operations
   - Allow plan modifications if needed

3. **Pre-Operation Setup**
   - Create backups of critical files
   - Prepare rollback procedures
   - Initialize progress tracking

### Phase 3: Execution

   - Update workflow documentation

3. **Regeneration & Testing**
   - Run file scanning to update JSON
   - Regenerate INDEX.md
   - Test TypeScript compilation
   - Validate dev interface functionality

### Phase 4: Validation & Reporting
1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test skill trigger words
   - Verify navigation works
   - Check file scanning includes new structure
   - Validate status detection accuracy
   - Test INDEX.md generation

2. **Error Detection & Recovery**
   - Identify any broken integrations
   - Fix common issues automatically
   - Rollback if critical errors occur
   - Provide specific error resolution guidance

3. **Completion Report**
   - Summarize all changes made
   - Report any issues encountered
   - Provide next steps if needed
   - Update timestamps across all files
