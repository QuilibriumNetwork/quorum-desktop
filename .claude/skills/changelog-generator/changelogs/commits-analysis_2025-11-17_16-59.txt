You are generating a changelog for Quorum, a decentralized messaging application. Your goal is to create content that excites users about new capabilities while being concise and scannable.

## Target Audience

- Focus on capabilities they can actually use
- Avoid all technical jargon and implementation details

## Required Format

Create both markdown (.md) and text (.txt) versions with this structure:

```markdown

```

## Writing Guidelines

### DO:
✅ **Keep it SHORT**: Maximum 1-2 bullet points per category
✅ **Focus on user benefits**: "What can I do now that I couldn't before?"
✅ **Use active language**: "Search member lists instantly" not "Member lists can now be searched"
✅ **Group related commits**: Multiple small improvements → one concise description
✅ **Write for excitement**: Make users want to try the new features

### DON'T:
❌ **Use technical terms**: No "refactor", "implement", "optimize", "component", etc.
❌ **Mention file names**: No src/components/whatever.tsx references
❌ **Write long descriptions**: Keep bullet points under 15 words when possible
❌ **Include obvious things**: Don't state "works better now" without specifics

### Example Transformations:

**Multiple commits about pinning:**
- "Add pin message functionality"
- "Implement pin UI component"
- "Add unpin capability"

**Becomes:**
🎉 **New Features**
- Message pinning for important content

**Multiple enhancement commits:**
- "🎨 style: improve button styling"
- "🎨 style: enhanced modal animations"
- "🎨 style: update color scheme"

**Becomes:**
✨ **Enhancements**
- Smoother animations and updated visual design

## Output Requirements

1. **Save markdown version** to the path specified in the script parameters
2. **Save text version** (remove markdown formatting, keep emojis)
3. **Include footer** with commit statistics
4. **Only include categories** that have actual commits (skip empty sections)
5. **Maximum 2 bullet points per category** - be selective and impactful

## Quality Check
Before finalizing, ask yourself:
- Would a non-technical user understand and get excited about this?
- Is each bullet point under 15 words?
- Does it focus on user capabilities, not technical achievements?
- Would users want to test these features?

Generate the changelog now, focusing on making users excited about what they can do with these improvements!
