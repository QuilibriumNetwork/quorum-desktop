Getting Started & Basics
What is Quorum Messenger and how do I start using it?
Quorum Messenger is the world’s first secure, peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) group messaging app. It's capable of handling extremely large groups with the same bandwidth required as direct messages.

It’s free to use, requires no phone number or payment, and lets you join conversations instantly. Creating an account requires only three steps: create a passkey, give yourself a display name and set a contact photo (both of which are sent and shown only to users you communicate with).

How does Quorum support freedom of speech?
Quorum champions freedom of speech by letting you speak freely within your communities without fear. Its Spaces are self-moderated, meaning your friend groups or communities — whether gamers, crypto enthusiasts, journalists, researchers, religious groups, political affiliates, or those avoiding politics — set their own rules. Unlike platforms with top-down censorship, Quorum hands control to users, ensuring your voice aligns with your community’s standards, not a central authority’s.

How is Quorum different from other chat applications?
Quorum combines visual familiarity of popular gaming-oriented chat apps, strong end-to-end encryption (E2EE), crypto-native features, and remarkable speed. Unlike typical community-focused chats lacking privacy or privacy-centric messengers facing centralized censorship risks, Quorum ensures robust privacy, decentralization, and resilience against censorship and single points of failure.

What does it mean that Quorum is peer-to-peer
Quorum operates on a peer-to-peer system, meaning your chats don’t rely on a central server that could be shut down. Powered by Quilibrium and the libp2p stack, it connects users directly, letting you message from anywhere, anytime. It supports multiple protocols like TCP, QUIC, Websockets, and even LoRa, offering flexibility and resilience — no single point of failure can disconnect you.

Is my data safe on Quorum?
Messages on Quorum are E2EE, nobody but you and your intended recipients can read your messages. But beware: users can still screenshot, and even forge screenshots. If you want to maintain privacy but also ensure messages are verifiable, you can enable "non-repudiability" in your settings, such that every message is signed by your user key.

How can I recover my account if I lose access?
When onboarding, users are asked to back up their user key. This is important, because there is no way to recover access to an account when lost.

How do I delete my account if I no longer want it?
Messages do not get retained on the network for longer than is required to deliver, so if you wish to delete your account, you may choose to delete messages and leave spaces, but to delete the account, simply delete your keys.

How do I get support, report problems or propose improvements?
Quorum has a space dedicated to its users, with feedback and bug reporting channels.

Is Quorum open source?
Yes, licensed AGPL.

Quorum Spaces
What is a Quorum Space?
A space is a community on Quorum, like what other platforms call servers, communities or guilds.

How many spaces can I join with one account?
You can join as many as you like, but be aware that this can get more intensive for processing and storage, as there is no central server for hosting messages — these are retained on your machine.

What customization options exist for Spaces?
Spaces can be customized to have their own banner and icon, and customizable roles. The client is open source, and can be extensively customized. We plan on making it easier to create themes in the future.

How can space administrators manage unwanted accounts/users?
Spaces have some levers to handle user influx: being invite only, restricting access to Apex subscribers, other future criteria (NFT/token gating coming soon).

How many people can join a Space?
There is no limit to how many users can join a space.

Quorum Apex
What is Quorum Apex?
Apex is Quorum's premium monthly subscription, supporting the development of the application, and provides the ability to sponsor spaces, such that space owners can earn QUIL from the sponsorships as well as gain access to additional benefits like vanity URLs and more. Users can subscribe to up to four spaces per Apex payment, similar to boosting servers on Discord, but with the added incentive of financially rewarding community creators.

How much is Quorum Apex?
Apex is planned to start at 50 QUIL/month, this number to be adjusted over time.

What ways can I pay for Quorum Apex?
Quorum Apex will start with accepting native QUIL, with wQUIL and other payment methods coming in the upcoming weeks.

What are Quorum Sponsors?
Quorum sponsors are users with an Apex subscription who have chosen a space for the month to sponsor. Spaces earn QUIL for their sponsorships. More information on how to redeem these earnings will be added to the Apex information page.

How do Space owners benefit from Sponsorship?
Sponsored spaces earn QUIL on a monthly basis, relative to the number of sponsors, are able to obtain vanity URLs with enough subscriptions, with more features planned soon.

How do I manage my Sponsorships?
Sponsorships can be managed either in user settings for Apex, or directly on the sponsored space. A sponsorship can only be changed once a month, so use wisely!

How can I manage my Apex subscription?
Apex subscriptions can be managed in user settings.

Mixed
What is Quorum performance like?
Quorum message delivery in the worst case takes up to a second for common Internet connections, but frequently takes less than 100ms.

Does Quorum support multimedia features and international languages?
Quorum currently supports image sharing and will soon add streaming audio/video, emojis, stickers, and file uploads. It also supports internationalization out-of-the-box, with openness to community-driven language contributions.

Can I run a bot on Quorum?
Creating a bot is extremely easy on Quorum, our client is open source and able to be run headless.

How can I migrate my community from other platforms to Quorum?
We plan on publishing a migration guide for community administrators on other platforms after launch.

What platforms does Quorum support?
Quorum runs on any modern web browser. Desktop clients will run on Mac, Windows, and Linux, mobile clients for iOS and Android. Desktop and Mobile are coming soon.

How is Quilibrium Inc. connected to Quorum?
Quilibrium Inc. is developing Quorum.

What data does Quorum/Q Inc collect?
Quilibrium Inc. collects no information about users, the Quorum application retains public keys in order to route messages, but there are no identifiers that link to a user's identity. For space subscriptions, the application will have to verify some information about space owners collecting earnings from subscriptions. This information is verified in zero knowledge, so we learn nothing about users in this process.

Does Quilibrium have an official home on Quorum?
Yes, there is an official node runner space.

How do you plan to build traction on Quorum?
We are reaching out to many industry peers who are wanting to leave other platforms as they have proven to be very unfriendly to web3, are centralized and prone to censorship, and not E2EE.

How long has Quorum been in development?
Quilibrium was originally built in service of making Quorum happen. Development has been occurring over the course of seven years.

Is there a Quorum feature roadmap available?
Broader roadmap will be shared in the coming days, but full feature parity with other popular chat applications is planned.
