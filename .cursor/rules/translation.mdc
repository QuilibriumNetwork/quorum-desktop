The translations are in the context of a messenger app.  When translating, keep this is mind.

Verify translations make sense by translating it back and compare against the original english translation.

Spaces are like a chat-room, with Channels being sub-chats in the Space.

Translations may have variables in curly-brackets, e.g. {0} or {user}.  These must be left intact in the translation, e.g. "My name is {name}" -> "Mi nombre es {name}".
